# Code Guide Project

I wrote this code guide to show and explain various path finding algorithms. It's built using raylib and uses Lua for scripting. The code is written in a pretty dirty way - my focus was on getting a nice visual representation of the algorithms rather than writing clean code and, most important for me: Getting it finished in a reasonable amount of time.

# Future topics

I don't consider this project finished. I have a few ideas for future topics:

* Showing how different heuristic functions for A* change the search progress
* Using flowfields to guide masses of agents to one point (e.g. to bring resources to a building)
* Using distance fields of the environment to handle agents of different sizes
* Handling dynamic obstacles

# Code Guide Project

I wrote this code guide to show and explain various path finding algorithms. It's built using raylib and uses Lua for scripting. The code is written in a pretty dirty way - my focus was on getting a nice visual representation of the algorithms rather than writing clean code and, most important for me: Getting it finished in a reasonable amount of time.
